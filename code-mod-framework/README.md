# Ultimate Code Mod Framework

A C project framework/template for those starting off with function replacement through SaltyNX.

## What it provides:

* The ability to replace functions with C reimplementations on runtime, either by symbol or by non-relocated address
* An IMPORT macro for automatically getting a relocated addresses from a non-relocated address
* A project set up for devkitpro targetting SaltyNX's plugin setup
* A set of lua2cpp and ACMD imports for calling back to the base game's functions

Please read [the wiki](https://github.com/ultimate-research/code-mod-framework/wiki) for guides and more information on getting started.
